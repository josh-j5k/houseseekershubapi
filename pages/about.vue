                <p>
                    We display thousands of new properties for sale or rent every month, 24 hours or more before they
                    appear on Rightmove or Zoopla, giving you a competitive edge in your search for your next home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As well as CMR residential properties, you can also search thousands of overseas properties for sale
                    and commercial CMR properties to rent and for sale, all from the comfort of your sofa or, by using
                    our mobile app, when you’re on-the-go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every property you see advertised with us is on the market with full-service estate or letting
                    agents who are experts in their local area. So, if you’re searching and find a property you’d like
                    to view, you can quickly and easily request a viewing with our online Viewing Time Requests tool.
                    Just pop in the day and time you’d like to view the property, and the estate agent will come back to
                    you directly to confirm your appointment or arrange another time if the appointment you’ve requested
                    isn’t available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Want to be one of the first to see properties that are Only With Us and any other newly added homes
                    which match your search requirements? Just set up an alert and you’ll receive details straight to
                    your inbox.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Found a home that’s stolen your heart but it’s already under offer? It happens, but we’re here to
                    help! Register for the Reserve Buyers List for the property, and if it does unexpectedly return to
                    the market, you’ll be one of the first to hear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can’t help with carrying the boxes, but we can help with the heavy‑lifting when it comes to
                    finding your next home
